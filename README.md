## Instructions to Run

### Directly use the executable
The .exe file of the latest build is in the base of the repo. Run it directly to use the software. We currently do not have any signed certificate for the executable. So, Windows will show a warning about unknown publisher.

### Build and run the project
- Download [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and install.
- Open the .sln file in the base of the repo.
- Build and run the project.
